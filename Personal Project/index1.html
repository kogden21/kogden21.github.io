      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science major. I'm not part of George Fox's music program, but I am taking piano lessons for fun.</p>
      <p>I began taking lessons when I was seven years old. My mom was the one who first suggested it to me, becuase she was tired of hearing me play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" nonstop and wanted me to learn something else.</p>
      <p>Piano has always been a hobby of mine more than anything else. I don't plan to ever play professionally. But I appreciate the variety of experiences playing the piano brings me that I would never encounter otherwise.</p>
