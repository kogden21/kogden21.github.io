      <p>Favorite pieces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maple Leaf Rag</li>
        <li>The Cascades</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fun facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joplin regarded ragtime as a form of classical music meant to be performed in concert halls and disdained the performance of ragtime as honky-tonk music.</li>
        <li>Joplin received most of his musical education from Julius Weiss, a German-born American Jewish music professor. Weiss, recognizing Joplin's talent and his family's financial difficulties, gave him piano lessons free of charge. In his later years, Joplin sent his former teacher "gifts of money when he was old and ill" until Weiss passed away.</li>
      </ul>
