      <p>Favorite pieces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maple Leaf Rag</li>
        <li>The Cascades</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fun facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joplin regarded ragtime as a form of classical music meant to be performed in concert halls and disdained the performance of ragtime as honky-tonk music.</li>
        <li>Joplin received most of his musical education from Julius Weiss, a German-born American Jewish music professor. Weiss, recognizing Joplin's talent and his family's financial difficulties, gave him piano lessons free of charge. In his later years, Joplin sent his former teacher "gifts of money when he was old and ill" until Weiss passed away.</li>

      <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a></h3>
      <img src="Sergei_Rachmaninoff.jpg" alt="Sergei Rachmaninoff" width=300>
      <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rachmaninov.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>
      <p>Favorite pieces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2</li>
        <li>Prelude in E-flat Major, Op. 23, No. 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fun facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The premiere of Rachmaninoff's first symphony was a disaster due to under-rehearsal and the possible intoxication of the conductor. Despite its poor initial reception, it is now seen as a powerful and finely-constructed piece, "achieving a genuinely tragic and heroic expression".</li>
        <li>Before his first tour in the United States, Rachmaninoff received offers from numerous pianon manufacturers to tour with their instruments. He chose Steinway, the only manufacturer that did not offer him money. His association with Steinway continued for the rest of his life.</li>
